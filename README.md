# Live_video_stream_app

1. Backend Development (Python with Flask and MongoDB):

a. Set Up Flask Application:
- Create a new Flask project and set up the necessary folders and files.
- Initialize MongoDB connection for storing overlay settings and user data.

b. RTSP Video Streaming:
- Implement a video player in Flask that can play video from the given RTSP URL.
- Integrate a video streaming library or solution compatible with RTSP (e.g., OpenCV or FFmpeg).

c. Overlay Management API (CRUD Operations):
- Create API endpoints for overlay management (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Use MongoDB to store overlay settings, including position, size, and content.
- Implement validation and authentication for user access to these endpoints.

2. Frontend Development (React):

a. Landing Page:
- Create a landing page using React where users can view the livestream video.
- Embed the video player and add basic controls (play, pause, volume adjustment).

b. Overlay Options:
- Implement a feature that allows users to add custom overlays (logos, text) on top of the livestream.
- Provide controls for positioning and resizing these overlays.

c. User Interface for CRUD Operations:
- Create user interfaces for managing overlays and settings.
- Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete overlay settings through the frontend.

3. Integration:

Connect the React frontend to the Flask backend through API calls.
Ensure that overlay settings are synchronized between the frontend and backend.
4. Styling and UI/UX:

Design an appealing user interface for the landing page and overlay management.
Implement responsive design for various screen sizes.
5. Video Streaming and RTSP Integration:

Integrate a video streaming library compatible with RTSP into your Flask backend.
Handle video playback and controls on the frontend.
6. Testing:

Test the application thoroughly, including video streaming, overlay management, and CRUD operations.
Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing as needed.
7. Documentation:

Create API documentation that details the CRUD endpoints and how to interact with them (e.g., using Swagger or other documentation tools).
Prepare user documentation explaining how to set up and use the app, including instructions for inputting the RTSP URL and managing overlays.
8. Deployment:

Deploy your application to a server or cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
Set up a production-ready environment with proper security measures.
9. Maintenance and Updates:

Monitor and maintain the deployed application.
Address any issues or bugs reported by users.
Consider adding additional features or improvements based on user feedback.
10. Version Control and Repository:

Maintain a code repository (e.g., on GitHub) for version control and collaboration.
This is a complex project, so it's important to break it down into smaller tasks and tackle each one step by step. Make sure to thoroughly test your application at each stage of development to ensure it meets the desired functionality and quality standards.
